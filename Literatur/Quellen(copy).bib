All these devices use only pn-junctions. Common uses of a diode include a reversed current protection circuit, clamping circuit, voltage doubler, and a voltage clipper which ensures that the voltage does not exceed a certain value. Solar panels are connected in series to increase their total voltage and in parallel to get more power; diodes are used to bypass damaged solar cells. Schottky diodes have the advantage of a very low turn-on voltage and very fast switching speeds, nanoseconds instead of microseconds for standard semiconductor diodes. The main advantage of Zener diodes over regular semiconductor diodes is that they can be designed to have a very specific, controlled reversed voltage and can operate in reversed breakdown mode without burning up.},

Recent welding economics research has focused on developing a reliable machinery database to ensure optimum production. Research on welding of materials like steel is still critical and ongoing. Welding input parameters play a very significant role in determining the quality of a weld joint. The metal active gas (MAG) welding parameters are the most important factors affecting the quality, productivity, and cost of welding in many industrial operations. The aim of this study is to investigate the optimization of process parameters for metal active gas welding for 60 mm{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}60 mm{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}5 mm dead mild steel plate work piece using the Taguchi method to formulate the statistical experimental design using a semi-automatic welding machine. An experimental study was conducted in the automotive industry, Bishoftu, Ethiopia. This study presents the influence of four welding parameters (control factors) like welding voltage (volt), welding current (ampere), wire-speed (m/min.), and gas (CO2) flow rate (Lt./min.) with three different levels for variability in the welding hardness. The objective functions have been chosen in relation to parameters of MAG welding i.e., welding hardness in final products. Nine experimental runs based on an L9 orthogonal array (OA) Taguchi method was performed. An OA, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to investigate the welding characteristics of dead mild steel plate and used in order to obtain optimum levels for every input parameter at 95{\%} confidence level. The optimal parameters setting was found is welding voltage at 22 V, welding current at 125 amperes, wire speed at 2.15 m/min, and gas flow rate at 19 Lt./min. by using the Taguchi experimental design method within the constraints of the production process. Finally six conformations welding have been carried out to compare the existing values; predicted values with the experimental values confirm its effectiveness in the analysis of welding hardness (quality) in final products. It is found that welding current has a major influence on the quality of welded joints. Experimental results for optimum setting gave better hardness of welding condition than initial setting. This study is valuable for different material and thickness variation of welding plate for Ethiopian industries.},

	abstract={One function of shielding gases used in welding processes, such as hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), helium (He), argon (Ar) and their mixtures, is protection of the weld pool against harmful contamination that could generate defects. In addition to this primary function, shielding gases significantly affect the shape of the weld, weld geometry, seam appearance, metallurgical and mechanical properties, welding speed, metal transfer, arc stability or beam and fume emissions. The shielding gas is thus a key factor in determining weld joint properties and welding process efficiency. As welding processes have become enhanced and welding research has advanced, different combinations of shielding gas mixtures have become available under a wide variety of trademarks, each claiming to offer the best efficiency. The shielding gas flow rate in GMAW welding is usually set according to empirical experiment. The flow generally remains unchanged throughout the entire welding process and is set at maximum values of the welding parameters so that there is sufficient gas cover. This setting means, however, that unnecessarily large quantities of shielding gas may be consumed in other phases of the welding process. In view of constantly increasing prices and shortfalls in helium supply, there is a need to optimize the use of shielding gas. Consequently, an ability to closely monitor the shielding gas blend and reduce waste can provide valuable cost savings. This paper examines the effects of shielding gas mixtures and their components, presents a cross-comparison of shielding effects in fusion welding and suggests guidelines for adaptive controllability of shielding gas in advanced adaptive fusion welding. The study reviews scientific case studies and experiments from the point of view of the effect of the shielding gas on the process efficiency and process outcome. The study considers shielding gases for welding of both ferrous metals (i.e. carbon steels, stainless steels, high-strength steels) and non-ferrous metals (i.e. aluminium and its alloys, nickel and its alloys and copper and its alloys). Appropriate choice of shielding gas and use of an optimum flow rate results in better quality in terms of increased productivity, reduced gas consumption and improved weld geometry properties, microstructure and mechanical properties. Although some blends can be used effectively in many different processes, other blends appear process-dependent; they produce far poorer results when utilized in non-appropriate processes. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and Schlieren techniques can be used for visual sensing of gas flow during fusing welding. Moreover, an adaptive alternative gas supply can improve welding performance and weld quality and reduce harmful fume emission.},

Establishing the optimum combination of process parameters is required to ensure better bead geometry and desired properties. The above objectives can be achieved by identifying the significant input process parameters as input to the mathematical models like welding voltage (X1), wire feed rate (X2), welding speed (X3), and nozzle-to-plate distance (X4). The identified responses governing the bead geometry are bead width (W) and height of the reinforcement (H). The mathematical models were constructed using the data collected from the experiments based on Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Then, the responses were optimized using non-traditional nature-inspired technique like genetic algorithm (GA).},

Aiming at the problem that the dynamic motion primitive algorithm is only suitable for an ideal and fixed motion environment during the demonstration and learning process, this paper proposes a robot motion trajectory control based on the ant colony algorithm, and proposes an ant colony optimization algorithm with self-adjusting the number of ants. The factors that affect the number of ants is the distance between the start point and the end point and the complexity of the map environment. After constructing an intelligent robot based on machine vision, based on the motion trajectory planning model, this paper collects data through machine vision, and realizes the intelligent planning and control of robot motion based on the motion planning algorithm. Through experimental research, it can be known that the intelligent robot system based on machine vision constructed in this paper can identify obstacles in complex environments and carry out reasonable trajectory planning.},

In the future, this tendency will be accentuated by integration of numerous robots (e.g. wheeled robots, legged robots, humanoid robots, network sensors, etc.) in the human environment. A wide range of applications, such as those dealing with warehouse management, industrial assembling, military applications, daily‐life tasks, can benefit from multi‐robot systems. The purpose of this paper is to propose an intelligent system for industrial robotics in the logistic field, based on collaboration between heterogeneous robots. Design/methodology/approach The proposed infrastructure for this multi‐robot system is composed of a robots' network including one humanoid robot, wheeled robots, cameras, and remote computer. All devices can communicate between them by using wireless network. The goal of the humanoid robot is to lead the wheeled robots according to the environment and wheeled robots are used to carry a load. The camera allows providing complementary information about the environment; and thanks to machine learning, this control strategy allows complex tasks to be perormed for these logistic applications. Findings This concept is implemented on real robots within the frame of a demonstrator including the above‐mentioned kind of robots. The preliminary results, obtained during experimentations, prove the feasibility of the presented strategy for real applications. Originality/value The main originalities of this work are, on the one hand, the use of an heterogeneous multi‐robots system for logistic tasks, and on the other hand, the proposed machine learning allows a collaboration task between heterogeneous robots in an autonomous manner.},

	abstract={Adaptability in manufacturing context is the ability of either the workplace topology defined by the combination of hardware and software components or any of the workplace's parts (i.e. hardware and software components and humans) to rapidly modify their characteristics and behaviours to cope with changing circumstances. Manufacturing systems need to be ``Adaptive'' to an ever-changing environment. This means also put together humans and automation taking advantage of each other's strengths to balance flexibility and productivity requirements in an easy and cost effective way. To achieve this challenge, companies need to re-design production systems. Enabling ``Adaptive and Smart Manufacturing Systems'' was indeed considered one of the challenges for Europe 2020 strategy to be addressed promoting market-oriented projects by bringing together private and public resources. This chapter aims to introduce Europe 2020 strategy for the manufacturing sector, the role of European Factories of the Future Research Association (EFFRA) as industry-driven association promoting the development of new and innovative production technologies and pre-competitive research by engaging in a public--private partnership with the European Union called `Factories of the Future'. Some success stories in the ``Adaptive and smart Manufacturing Systems'' research domain will be introduced and, in particular, the project A4BLUE (Grant ID 723,828) will be illustrated in more detail for its interesting results addressing the expected scientific challenge and scope of FOF-04-2016 (Continuous adaptation of work environments with changing levels of automation in evolving production systems).},

The point cloud model of steel mesh is obtained by three-dimensional vision structured light camera.

Commission VIII agreed to an updated statement on the possible causes of this excess risk and made recommendations for preventive actions to assist in reducing the risk in 2003. This was provided to IIW Member Societies as a Commission VIII Document in 2004 and a published Consensus Statement in 2005. In the 2005 Consensus Statement the Commission remarked that the apparent link between lung cancer and welding as an occupation suggested that the work environment was likely to play a part in causation. The prime suspects identified from the evidence were fume from welding processes, tobacco smoke and asbestos dust --- acting alone or together. It was thought by some, that social factors other than occupation, but reflecting income may also play a part. The topic has been kept under review. The elevated risk of lung cancer among welders has persisted in the published medical literature. This 2010 report summarizes, makes comments on and draws conclusions from evidence from the published scientific literature on the topic. Commission VIII ratifies its 2003 Statement, concludes from the review that the prime suspects remain the same and that the cause of the elevated risk has yet to be resolved. Everyone in the industries concerned is exhorted to take effective action to protect welders and those who work with them. Special emphasis is placed on the need to control exposure to welding fumes, at least to national standards, to prevent all exposure to asbestos dust and to encourage and assist welders to avoid exposing themselves and others to tobacco smoke.},

	abstract={Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) mainly rely on the service composition mechanism which supports the reusability. Numerous researches focus on this thematic in order to satisfy all the objectives of quality fixed by the SOA community. One of these objectives is the notion of loose coupling between the composition's services. However this notion is intuitively understood and tangible, its definition lacks formalism. This unclear picture of the loose coupling is reflected in limited metrics which do not allow for its quantitative and objective evaluation. In this paper, we propose a set of different metrics which are associated with a clear definition of the loose coupling notion. These metrics act as guidelines for architects to develop their composite service. They are gathered in a formula which allows for evaluating the global coupling of a composition of services. Moreover, they are also used as comparison criteria for classifying existing composition models.},  keywords={},

It also presents six strategies for designing interfaces: to follow familiar ways of doing things, to not omit required functionality, to present uncluttered interfaces, to provide documentation, to provide multiple ways to perform the same functionality, and to provide customizability. The chapter discusses how to reconcile the often-conflicting demands of generality and ease of use. It concludes with SOLID, an easy-to-remember acronym that describes the most important design principles.}
