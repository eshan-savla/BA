In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: {PCL} (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). {PCL} presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. {PCL} is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of {PCL} including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

	abstract = {The demand of High Definition Maps ({HD}-Maps) has been increasing, especially for autonomous vehicle application. Usually, {HD}-Map is created by scanning the road using {LiDAR} sensor and reconstructing the road on 3D world to capture all aspects of road properties. One of the important properties of a road is its edge or boundary. In this paper, we propose end-to-end 3D Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Network (3D-{EDCN}) for road edge detection on 3D point cloud data produced by {LiDAR} sensor. Our 3D-{EDCN} classifier consists of nine convolutional layers and three deconvolutional layers. For simplification, we use 3D voxel format as input and output of the classifier. Our proposed method was tested using our own 3D point cloud dataset which taken from {LiDAR} equipment and consisting of 103 3D point cloud data with their respective road edge ground truth. In the training process, we use combinations of Cross-Entropy loss function and Euclidean loss function to help our model converged. As a preliminary result, our proposed 3D-{EDCN} classifier achieves Mean Square Error ({MSE}) of 2.738×10-5, precision of 0.37262, and recall of 0.14432.},

So there is a need to apply a parallel algorithm on it, and usually the computation for {ANN} is inherently parallel. In this paper, graphic hardware is used to speed up the computation of {ANN}. In recent years, graphic processing unit ({GPU}) grows faster than {CPU}. Graphic hardware venders provide programmability on {GPU}. In this paper, application of commodity available {GPU} for two kinds of {ANN} models was explored. One is the self-organizing maps ({SOM}); the other is multi layer perceptron ({MLP}). The computation result shows that {ANN} computing on {GPU} is much faster than on standard {CPU} when the neural network is large. And some design rules for improve the efficiency on {GPU} are given.},

Our approach detects several types of edges, and makes use of both 3D shape information and photometric texture information. Edges are categorized as occluding edges, occluded edges, boundary edges, high-curvature edges, and {RGB} edges. We exploit the organized structure of the {RGB}-D image to efficiently detect edges, enabling near real-time performance. We present two applications of these edge features: edge-based pair-wise registration and a pose-graph {SLAM} approach based on this registration, which we compare to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of edge detection and edge-based registration both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

This method is named Analysis of Geometric Properties of Neighborhoods ({AGPN}), and it includes two main steps: edge detection and feature line tracing. In the edge detection step, {AGPN} analyzes geometric properties of each query point’s neighborhood, and then combines {RANdom} {SAmple} Consensus ({RANSAC}) and angular gap metric to detect edges. In the feature line tracing step, feature lines are traced by a hybrid method based on region growing and model fitting in the detected edges. Our approach is experimentally validated on complex man-made objects and large-scale urban scenes with millions of points. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our method obtains a promising, reliable, and high performance in detecting edges and tracing feature lines in 3D-point clouds. Moreover, {AGPN} is insensitive to the point density of the input data.},

Our edge detection method evaluates symmetry in a local neighborhood and uses an adaptive density based threshold to differentiate 3D edge points. We extend this algorithm to propose a novel corner detector that clusters curvature vectors and uses their geometrical statistics to classify a point as corner. We perform rigorous evaluation of the algorithms on {RGB}-D semantic segmentation and 3D washer models from the {ShapeNet} dataset and report higher precision and recall scores. Finally, we also demonstrate how our edge and corner detectors can be used as a novel approach towards automatic weld seam detection for robotic welding. We propose to generate weld seams directly from a point cloud as opposed to using 3D models for offline planning of welding paths. For this application, we show a comparison between Harris 3D and our proposed approach on a panel workpiece.},

	abstract = {Tessellated surfaces generated from point clouds typically show inaccurate and jagged boundaries. This can lead to tolerance errors and problems such as machine judder if the model is used for ongoing manufacturing applications. This paper introduces a novel boundary point detection algorithm and spatial {FFT}-based filtering approach, which together allow for direct generation of low noise tessellated surfaces from point cloud data, which are not based on pre-defined threshold values. Existing detection techniques are optimized to detect points belonging to sharp edges and creases. The new algorithm is targeted at the detection of boundary points and it is able to do this better than the existing methods. The {FFT}-based edge reconstruction eliminates the problem of defining a specific polynomial function order for optimum polynomial curve fitting. The algorithms were tested to analyse the results and measure the execution time for point clouds generated from laser scanned measurements on a turbofan engine turbine blade with varying numbers of member points. The reconstructed edges fit the boundary points with an improvement factor of 4.7 over a standard polynomial fitting approach. Furthermore, through adding artificial noise it has been demonstrated that the detection algorithm is very robust for out-of-plane noise lower than 25\% of the cloud resolution and it can produce satisfactory results when the noise is lower than 75\%.{HighlightsIntroducing} novel boundary point detection algorithm and spatial {FFT}-based filtering approach.Enabling reliable detection of boundary points and smooth boundary reconstruction.{FFT}-based edge reconstruction works better than polynomial curve fitting.Optimally smoothed edges facilitate the direct use of tessellated models for {CAM} tasks.The new detection algorithm tolerates out-of-plane noise.The reconstructed edges fit well the detected boundary points.},

These parameters, stored in a Scale-Space Matrix ({SSM}), provide a well-suited information from which an adequate neural network can learn the description of edges and use it to efficiently detect them in acquired point clouds. After successfully applying a multi-scale {CNN} on {SSMs} for the efficient classification of edges and their neighborhood, we propose a new lightweight neural network architecture outperforming the {CNN} in learning time, processing time, and classification capabilities.

Point clouds obtained by 3D scanner devices are often immense in terms of size. Edges are essential features in large scale point clouds since they are capable of describing the shapes in down-sampled point clouds while maintaining the principal information. In this paper, we tackle challenges of edge detection tasks in 3D point clouds. To this end, we propose a novel technique to detect edges of point clouds based on a capsule network architecture. In this approach, we define the edge detection task of point clouds as a semantic segmentation problem. We built a classifier through the capsules to predict edge and non-edge points in 3D point clouds. We applied a weakly-supervised learning approach in order to improve the performance of our proposed method and built in the capability of testing the technique in wider range of shapes. We provide several quantitative and qualitative experimental results to demonstrate the robustness of our proposed {EDC}-Net for edge detection in 3D point clouds. We performed a statistical analysis over the {ABC} and {ShapeNet} datasets. Our numerical results demonstrate the robust and efficient performance of {EDC}-Net.},
