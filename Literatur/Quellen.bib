In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: {PCL} (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). {PCL} presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. {PCL} is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of {PCL} including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

Usually, {HD}-Map is created by scanning the road using {LiDAR} sensor and reconstructing the road on 3D world to capture all aspects of road properties. One of the important properties of a road is its edge or boundary. In this paper, we propose end-to-end 3D Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Network (3D-{EDCN}) for road edge detection on 3D point cloud data produced by {LiDAR} sensor. Our 3D-{EDCN} classifier consists of nine convolutional layers and three deconvolutional layers. For simplification, we use 3D voxel format as input and output of the classifier. Our proposed method was tested using our own 3D point cloud dataset which taken from {LiDAR} equipment and consisting of 103 3D point cloud data with their respective road edge ground truth. In the training process, we use combinations of Cross-Entropy loss function and Euclidean loss function to help our model converged. As a preliminary result, our proposed 3D-{EDCN} classifier achieves Mean Square Error ({MSE}) of 2.738×10-5, precision of 0.37262, and recall of 0.14432.},

In the edge detection step, {AGPN} analyzes geometric properties of each query point’s neighborhood, and then combines {RANdom} {SAmple} Consensus ({RANSAC}) and angular gap metric to detect edges. In the feature line tracing step, feature lines are traced by a hybrid method based on region growing and model fitting in the detected edges. Our approach is experimentally validated on complex man-made objects and large-scale urban scenes with millions of points. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our method obtains a promising, reliable, and high performance in detecting edges and tracing feature lines in 3D-point clouds.

We perform rigorous evaluation of the algorithms on {RGB}-D semantic segmentation and 3D washer models from the {ShapeNet} dataset and report higher precision and recall scores. Finally, we also demonstrate how our edge and corner detectors can be used as a novel approach towards automatic weld seam detection for robotic welding.

For this application, we show a comparison between Harris 3D and our proposed approach on a panel workpiece.},

	abstract = {Tessellated surfaces generated from point clouds typically show inaccurate and jagged boundaries. This can lead to tolerance errors and problems such as machine judder if the model is used for ongoing manufacturing applications. This paper introduces a novel boundary point detection algorithm and spatial {FFT}-based filtering approach, which together allow for direct generation of low noise tessellated surfaces from point cloud data, which are not based on pre-defined threshold values. Existing detection techniques are optimized to detect points belonging to sharp edges and creases. The new algorithm is targeted at the detection of boundary points and it is able to do this better than the existing methods. The {FFT}-based edge reconstruction eliminates the problem of defining a specific polynomial function order for optimum polynomial curve fitting. The algorithms were tested to analyse the results and measure the execution time for point clouds generated from laser scanned measurements on a turbofan engine turbine blade with varying numbers of member points. The reconstructed edges fit the boundary points with an improvement factor of 4.7 over a standard polynomial fitting approach. Furthermore, through adding artificial noise it has been demonstrated that the detection algorithm is very robust for out-of-plane noise lower than 25\% of the cloud resolution and it can produce satisfactory results when the noise is lower than 75\%.{HighlightsIntroducing} novel boundary point detection algorithm and spatial {FFT}-based filtering approach.Enabling reliable detection of boundary points and smooth boundary reconstruction.{FFT}-based edge reconstruction works better than polynomial curve fitting.Optimally smoothed edges facilitate the direct use of tessellated models for {CAM} tasks.The new detection algorithm tolerates out-of-plane noise.The reconstructed edges fit well the detected boundary points.},

In this paper, we tackle challenges of edge detection tasks in 3D point clouds. To this end, we propose a novel technique to detect edges of point clouds based on a capsule network architecture. In this approach, we define the edge detection task of point clouds as a semantic segmentation problem. We built a classifier through the capsules to predict edge and non-edge points in 3D point clouds. We applied a weakly-supervised learning approach in order to improve the performance of our proposed method and built in the capability of testing the technique in wider range of shapes. We provide several quantitative and qualitative experimental results to demonstrate the robustness of our proposed {EDC}-Net for edge detection in 3D point clouds.

Despite the fast evolution of learning-based 3D semantic segmentation methods, little attention has been drawn to the learning of 3D semantic edge detectors, even less to a joint learning method for the two tasks. In this paper, we tackle the 3D semantic edge detection task for the first time and present a new two-stream fully-convolutional network that jointly performs the two tasks. In particular, we design a joint refinement module that explicitly wires region information and edge information to improve the performances of both tasks. Further, we propose a novel loss function that encourages the network to produce semantic segmentation results with better boundaries. Extensive evaluations on S3DIS and {ScanNet} datasets show that our method achieves on par or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and outperforms the baseline methods for semantic edge detection.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1901.02532},
	abstract = {This paper presents a very simple but efficient algorithm for 3D line segment detection from large scale unorganized point cloud. Unlike traditional methods which usually extract 3D edge points first and then link them to fit for 3D line segments, we propose a very simple 3D line segment detection algorithm based on point cloud segmentation and 2D line detection. Given the input unorganized point cloud, three steps are performed to detect 3D line segments. Firstly, the point cloud is segmented into 3D planes via region growing and region merging. Secondly, for each 3D plane, all the points belonging to it are projected onto the plane itself to form a 2D image, which is followed by 2D contour extraction and Least Square Fitting to get the 2D line segments. Those 2D line segments are then re-projected onto the 3D plane to get the corresponding 3D line segments. Finally, a post-processing procedure is proposed to eliminate outliers and merge adjacent 3D line segments. Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method. More results and the C++ source code of the proposed algorithm are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaohulugo/3DLineDetection.},

The algorithms can be dissected into combinatorial parts, discussed in Chapter 29, and geometric parts, discussed in this chapter. This illustrates how a set of geometric classes can be plugged into a generic combinatorial algorithm to produce a concrete algorithm operating on the geometry in question.},

	abstract = {Advanced data structures is a core course in Computer Science which most graduate program in Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, and other allied engineering disciplines, offer during the first year or first semester of the curriculum. The objective of this course is to enable students to have the much-needed foundation for advanced technical skill, leading to better problem-solving in their respective disciplines. Although the course is running in almost all the technical universities for decades, major changes in the syllabus have been observed due to the recent paradigm shift of computation which is more focused on huge data and internet-based technologies. Majority of the institute has been redefined their course content of advanced data structure to fit the current need and course material heavily relies on research papers because of nonavailability of the redefined text book advanced data structure. To the best of our knowledge well-known textbook on advanced data structure provides only partial coverage of the syllabus. 
The book offers comprehensive coverage of the most essential topics, including:



Part I details advancements on basic data structures, viz., cuckoo hashing, skip list, tango tree and Fibonacci heaps and index files. 


Part {II} details data structures of different evolving data domains like special data structures, temporal data structures, external memory data structures, distributed and streaming data structures. 


Part {III} elucidates the applications of these data structures on different areas of computer science viz, network, www, {DBMS}, cryptography, graphics to name a few. The concepts and techniques behind each data structure and their applications have been explained. 


Every chapter includes a variety of Illustrative Problems pertaining to the data structure(s) detailed, a summary of the technical content of the chapter and a list of Review Questions, to reinforce the comprehension of the concepts. 

The book could be used both as an introductory or an advanced-level textbook for the advanced undergraduate, graduate and research programmes which offer advanced data structures as a core or an elective course. While the book is primarily meant to serve as a course material for use in the classroom, it could be used as a starting point for the beginner researcher of a specific domain.},

The major contribution of this chapter is the proposal of a new kd-tree structure called the skd-tree. The algorithms for inserting, updating and searching the skd-tree have been presented. The skd-tree provides two types of search, one of which is not directly supported by other existing structures. To do a containment search using for for example R-trees [Gut84] or R+-trees [{SRF}87], an intersection search is performed on the directory and containment testing is performed only on the leaf nodes.},

	abstract = {Dieser erste Band der Informatik erklärt die grundlegenden Konzepte: Programmierung, Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen. Nach einer Einführung zum Aufbau von Rechnersystemen und zur Darstellung von Informationen folgt ein Einstieg in die Programmierung mit der Sprache Python. Dabei werden grundsätzliche Prinzipien von Programmiersprachen erläutert, darunter Schleifen, Rekursion, imperative, funktionale und objektorientierte Programmierkonzepte. Einige konkrete Projekte werden in Python realisiert, so etwa zur Datenbeschaffung im Internet und deren Aufbereitung oder zum Umgang mit diversen Sensoren und zur Steuerung externer Geräte mit dem Raspberry-Pi. Dem Objektorientierten Programmieren und insbesondere der Programmiersprache Java ist ein eigenes Kapitel gewidmet. Diese Sprache und ihre Infrastruktur unterstützen besonders die professionelle Entwicklung großer Projekte. Auch die neuesten Konzepte von Java (Lambdas, Ströme und Funktionale) werden anschaulich erläutert. Das letzte Kapitel behandelt klassische Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen: Such- und Sortieralgorithmen, Listen, Bäume, Graphen, Maps, und diverse andere Datentypen zum effi zienten Speichern, Wiederauffi nden und Transformieren von Daten. Diese werden mit ihren Vor- und Nachteilen und anhand von Java-Programmen dargestellt. Der zweite Band ist technischen Themen gewidmet – insbesondere der Rechnerarchitektur, Betriebssystemen, Rechnernetzen und speziell dem Internet. Der dritte und letzte Band der Buchreihe Informatik ist der Theoretischen Informatik gewidmet. Das Buch richtet sich an alle Einsteiger, die sich ernsthaft mit Informatik beschäftigen wollen, sei es zum Selbststudium oder zur Begleitung von Vorlesungen. In den folgenden Bänden dieses Buches werden die Themen, Rechnerarchitektur, Betriebssysteme, Rechnernetze, Internet, Compilerbau und Theoretische Informatik vertieft. Prof. Dr. Heinz-Peter Gumm ist Professor für Theoretische Informatik in Marburg.

	abstract = {In this project, we propose the implementation of a 3D object recognition system which will be optimized to operate under demanding time constraints. The system must be robust so that objects can be recognized properly in poor light conditions and cluttered scenes with significant levels of occlusion. An important requirement must be met: the system must exhibit a reasonable performance running on a low power consumption mobile {GPU} computing platform ({NVIDIA} Jetson {TK}1) so that it can be integrated in mobile robotics systems, ambient intelligence or ambient assisted living applications. The acquisition system is based on the use of color and depth ({RGB}-D) data streams provided by low-cost 3D sensors like Microsoft Kinect or {PrimeSense} Carmine. The range of algorithms and applications to be implemented and integrated will be quite broad, ranging from the acquisition, outlier removal or filtering of the input data and the segmentation or characterization of regions of interest in the scene to the very object recognition and pose estimation. Furthermore, in order to validate the proposed system, we will create a 3D object dataset. It will be composed by a set of 3D models, reconstructed from common household objects, as well as a handful of test scenes in which those objects appear. The scenes will be characterized by different levels of occlusion, diverse distances from the elements to the sensor and variations on the pose of the target objects. The creation of this dataset implies the additional development of 3D data acquisition and 3D object reconstruction applications. The resulting system has many possible applications, ranging from mobile robot navigation and semantic scene labeling to human-computer interaction ({HCI}) systems based on visual information.},
